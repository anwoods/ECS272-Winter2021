# Homework 3: Visualization Dashboard:  Interaction Design for Spotify
To see homework 3, download all the files in anwoods folder and then open the html page in FireFox. The whole thing takes a minute to load, be patient. The dropdown menu for the donut chart also takes time to load. To get the dropdown menu for the donut chart, press it once and wait for a minute. The detail charts are initially showing all the dat from 1921-2020.

## Bar Chart Interactions
For the bar chart you can hover over the bars to see a tooltip.
For the grey bar chart at the bottom you can drag across to select a section of the bars above.
After a selection has been made the detail charts (radar, donut chart) will be updated by filtering the data from the years chosen. A text saying "Updated Detail Charts to Years Selection" will appear and disappear at the top of the detail charts column.
Additionally in the top bar chart you can select/deselect any bar anywhere in the chart by clicking on it.
When the Sort Values is checked, the bar charts will perform an animation that sorts the bars based on their y value.The sort value can be unchecked to see the bar chart in the original temporal order.

## Radar Chart Interactions
You can hover over the individual area plots to bring that area plot to the front of the screen. Also, note that the radar chart shows only the 3 most popular artist of the year selection. If you change the year selection slightly and the radar chart appears to not change it means that those 3 arists are still the most popular for the new year selection.

## Donut Chart Interactions
After a year selection has been made the dropdown menu is filtered to only artists of those years. The donut chart will additionally only show songs from that year of the artist selected.
When a new year selection occurs the top popular artist for the year selection is used as a default.
You can hover over the donut chart to see a tooltip.
